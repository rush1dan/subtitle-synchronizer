# Subtitle Synchronizer

## Subtitle Time-stamp Modifier GUI Program

This program helps you to modify all the time stamps of a subtitle (.srt or .txt) file through an easy to use GUI built with Python tkinter framework. This solves the issue where often times video players like VLC lag or freeze when changing the subtitle delay duration by a big amount. You can just dial in your required duration (as large or small as required) in the program and then use the newly generated subtitle file with all the time stamps modified according to your input, thus resolving the aforementioned issue.


## Usage

Just download and use the .exe provided in the releases.
